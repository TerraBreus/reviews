## The Wringing Cloth (2025)
_By Old Saw_

What a wonderful example of how far the oceans of the musical library stretches. With elements of western, gypsy, acoustic arpeggios, analogue synths, ambient sounds and much, much more, this album creates a meditative experience that, if given proper care, floods you with nostalgia and melancholy. You won't be finding any groovy tunes and quite some attention is required to find the melodies hidden in the hypnotic sea of arpeggios, but my goodness is this a refreshing take on what music can be and do.

This is an album to stare out of the window to and watch the snow fall while your mind wonders to places strangely familiar.

7/10

_I would like to give this an 8 but for some reason a 7 rings more true to me_
