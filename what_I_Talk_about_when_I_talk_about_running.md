# **What I talk about when I talk about running** 
_By Haruki Murakami. Translated from Japanese by Philip Gabriel._

A very fitting title. This isn't a book about running alone. 
It is a collection of thoughts and personal experiences that Murakami carefully curated over two years. There is some chronology but technically, this book can be read from any page.

A good read I would say. Murakami seems very ambitious and sometimes his drive can make you feel quite shitty for not having your shit together.
However Murakami frequently humanizes himself. It's not all "_Just Do It!_", "_Stop complaining!_" and "_If I can do it, you can too!_". 
There are fragile moments where Murakami shares his failures and he clearly acknowledges his lifestyle isn't for everybody. In Murakami's words "_this is just the way I am_".

Some of his views seemed a bit outdated. I didn't like how, when he talks about women, it is mostly an emphasis on their looks and I wouldn't count on Murakami for relationship advice. On an existential level however, Murakami seems deeply, deeply human and I would love to go for a run with this seventy-something-year old man.

**A few memorable quotes** (_how I remember them_): 

`"The most important lesson we learn in school is that we don't learn the most important lessons in school"`

`"In most cases learning something essential in life requires physical pain"`

7/10
