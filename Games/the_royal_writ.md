## The Royal Writ
_Developed by Save Sloth Studios, Published by Yogscast Games_

Included in the Jingle Jam Bundle of 2025, I found myself drawn to this game due to its incredibly cute art style. As a big fan of deck building roguelikes such as _Slay the Spire_ and _Balatro_ it seemed to scratch that same itch but after a while interest was lost due to a certain quality of life.

Now, that is not to say this is a bad game. There are a lot of good things to be said. _Save Sloth Studios_ have a wonderful art style and a knack for good story telling. _The Royal Writ_ is no exception. Topped with witty and cute songs this game has you enjoying the first few hours with a lovely back story that progresses as the game gets more and more difficult. Halfway through the story the gameplay changes significantly, separating it into two different acts.

But after a while I found myself scratching my head trying to figure out how certain cards got their stats or how their mechanic is supposed to work. The tutorial guides you through the basics and there is a 'help' page to explain statuses but not everything has its own article. Some things you have to figure out by trial and error. 

Unfortunately, this makes a deck building roguelike very annoying to play through. You might have gotten a really good run but couldn't realise it because you didn't understand the mechanics. It is the same principle that makes replaying this game less rewarding. You want to understand your deck through and through in order to enjoy it and the game, as cute and witty as it looks, doesn't allow you to do so. Unless you are prepared to figure everything out yourself.

_Save Sloth Studios_ seem like an incredibly duo of a studio and perhaps the community will help them polish this to a decent game. Untill then I would recommend it for the storytelling and artstyle, but not for its core gameplay.

5/10
