## Dungeons of Hinterberg (DNF)
_developed by MicroBird Games (2024)_

Visually very striking which was at first what drew me to playing this game. I got through the tutorial but rather quickly lost interest due to the jankiness I experienced. For a game that seems to revolve so much around fighting and exploring, I found the controls to be too rough and unpolished. It did not feel like I was in complete control which stopped the immersion necessary to come back. This might just be a physical issue with me playing a Windows game on a Linux based OS, but I found it more a chore to come back. 

For some reason, I also found myself skipping or rushing through the cutscenes, which is somewhat unusual. I think I prefer having the option of still walking around when cutscenes or dialogue happen instead of just having to put down all controls and watch.
