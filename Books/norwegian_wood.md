## Norwegian Wood
_by Haruki Murakami. Translated by Jay Rubin_

Indubitably Murakami is one of the better writers out there. Even translated, the book reads like an absolute dream and I found myself racing through the story in less than a week. It appears to me that Murakami understands himself and his readers through and through. The book mentions many other literary and musical classics including some subtle self-references to the "_The Catcher In The Rye_" which it runs quite parallel with. Both Toru Watanabe and Holden Caufield share a sense of isolation in their journey towards adolescense and look at people astray, observing but not involving if there is no particular need to.

As every early adolescent, sex plays a huge role and there are some erotic scenes in here I wasn't quite expecting. Murakami writings were, like the cover of the book states '_sexy and hip_'. This made it a bit difficult to read in public at times... In addition I found Murakami's view on sex rather male-centred and a bit distorted. I fail to see whether this was done intentional. Part of Murakami's critical acclaim is due to his subtle usage of metaphors and perhaps I am being somewhat superfical stating this as critique but I simply do not believe that all the women he had sex with ended up having an orgasm. 

Reaching the end of the book I felt some kind of dissapointment. It is unclear to me currently whether this a good or a bad thing so I will just leave it for what it is. 

6.5/10
