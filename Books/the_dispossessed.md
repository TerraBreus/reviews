## The Dispossessed
_By Ursule K. Le Guin_

Books like _1984_, _A Brave New World_ and _Fahrenheit 451_ are generally considered classics in the genre of dystopian world views. Yet somehow, _The Dispossessed_ is not part of those classics. And rightly so! Ursula K. Le Guin distinguishes herself from all the classics by not only showing the problem, but also showing a possible solution.

Now this solution is primiraly rooted in anarchism and somewhat vague at times. For no unparticular reason is the subtitle of this book: _An Ambiguous Utopia_. Le Guin herself also addresses some of the possible problems an anarchist society might face and how a "true anarchist society" is a never ending, self-iterating process that constantly defies itself and actively tries to support new trains of thought. And it is precisely this self awareness that makes this book so great. Le Guin shows the subtelty of anarchism and its (possible) complications it might lead to when applied as an idealogy on an entire planet.

But it does not end there. Le Guin understands humans through and through. This book also shows why people might want to fall for capitalism, or socialism, or any other -ism that requires a centralized state to function. The human need for power to cover up internalized insecurity, the need for marriage, systems and rules for stability, the desire for quick fixes to cover up that gaping hole of uncertainty. Le Guin doesn't blatantly attack our predominant world view. She puts it in a light where we can understand how it came to be yet see how it ultimately is not the answer we're looking for.

If you then consider, that Le Guin did not write a philosophical essay but a science-fiction novel that, though maybe a bit slow at first, has you on the edge of your seat by the end - you might begin to understand what makes this novel such a masterpiece.

_This is one of those books I hope to reread once or twice a decade_
