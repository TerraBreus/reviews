## Men in the Sun (And Other Palestinian Stories)
_by Ghassan Kanafani, translated by Hilary Kilpatrick_

__I put of writing this review cause I am afraid of offending anybody. So before I start I want to point out I in no way want to "say" anything. This is not a text with a political message.  These are my own personal thoughts about my own personal experience.__

My mother, wanting to know more about Palestinian culture, gave this book to me for my birthday. It took me more than a month to finish the seven short stories that in total make up no more than a hundred pages. Kanafani is an amazing writer. Sentences flow like a cold breeze in the forest whispering tales of the dead. However I found myself often reading empty words either not understanding them, or not wanting to understand them. Though fiction, Kanafani's writing seems extremely political. Men in the Sun is both a cry for help to the rest of the world and a shoulder to cry on for the Palestinian people.

The short story _"if  you were a horse..."_ is one of the few stories where the cultural pain is not as prevalent and I found myself liking this story the most. However I reckon Kanafani did not write stories to enjoy. He wrote stories to give people (a fraction of) the pain he went through (and with him so many other Palestinians). This book seems incredibly important now and a cornerstone in the Palestinian literature. How Primo Levi wrote for the jews, so Ghassan Kanafani wrote for the Palestinians. However, whereas Levi wanted peace (oh the tragic irony), Kanafani seems to want retribution.

I almost did not finish this book. This is mostly a protection mechanism not wanting to know the terrible things happening on this earth while I am in no position (currently) to help, but also cause I have but scratched the surface of what reading can be. With guilt I must admit I read to enjoy. And I did not enjoy Kanafani's stories about the horrors of his people.
