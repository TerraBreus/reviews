Whoever said music needs to be complex to be good? 

Katie and Allison, the only two members of the band, make seemingly simple songs yet cut through the crap with honesty that not only shows in their lyrics, but also in their usage of instruments. Their sweet voices glide on top of a somewhat clunky mix of guitars, drums and bass. The melodies are catchy and many songs make you feel like you are about to set out to college - like a life is about to unfold.

After about six of these songs, things do start to feel a little repetitive in sound. Their lyrics might be able to carry some of the weight, but if you are like me and don't follow that too closely, you will likely get a bit bored around this point. However, you can easily resume it from here next time.

If you like a folky indie type of garage sound, this might be right up your alley.
