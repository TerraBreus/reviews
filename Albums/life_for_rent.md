## Life for rent

_by Dido_

With _Life for Rent_ Dido and her brother combine analog and digital with hints of rnb to create a sound that feels almost too defining for the 00's. Just for _white flag_ alone this album should be credited some kind of acclaim. The secret for this album seems to be Dido's smooth, fragile and thin voice gliding on top of the heavy drum samples and eerie synthesizers. Only on _This Land Is Mine_ do they not use this formula and it feels off because of it as well.

Most of the other songs on _life for rent_ are catchy and glued together by a coherent nostalgic atmosphere. Yet it swings a little on the corny side to come across as genuine. That's not to say this album isn't enjoyable, especially on a dark and gloomy night.

**Like:** White Flag, See You When You're 40, Sand in My Shoes

**Like least:** Mary's in India, This Land Is Mine

6/10
