## Colour Yes (special edition) 
_By Matthew Halsall_

Similar to "_Night Lights_" by Gerry Mulligan. If you put this on in the background you will soon find how the melodies have seeped into your brain. This is the type of jazz everybody can enjoy. It is smooth yet interesting with a lovely interplay between all the instruments to glue your ears to the monitor and brighten up your mood.

With more songs added for the special edition, this album is now over an hour long making it the perfect company to spicen up your dinner with. Or you can simply listen to it with your full attention and enjoy the colorful depth Matthew Halsall has created.

8/10
