## Special Computer (2025)
_by Sandokai_

Chaotic drums, guitar riffs with maximum overdrive and microtonality. This is doomer music from the sahara. Though maybe somewhat simple in sound, this album sucks you in to the point where you forget about other people which is great when you don't feel like socializing.

Halfway through, Sandokai tries to change from the heavy guitars by introducing futuristic organs and synthesizers.
However, this seems more like an irrelevant tangent from its main sound as when "Tonal Recal" hits its peak, the guitars and drums are back in action. 
By separating the song in two parts it becomes clear this was done with intention yet it feels more like a diluted introduction to the guitars rather than an actual song.

Overall a good collection of songs that isolate you from the world in a state of anger and confusion.
It does miss that kind of **umpf** that ties the songs together and creates the depth it is so close to reaching.
As of now, it scratches the surface of a universe but leaves you somewhat unfulfilled and dissatisfied throughout and at the end.

6/10
