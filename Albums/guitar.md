## Guitar
_by Mac DeMarco_

Mac DeMarco is a cornerstone of my teenage years. Around the age of fourteen I discovered _Salad Days_ and quickly formed an identity around this slacker shoegaze hippie that seemed to love life in his own silly way. I sure as hell wasn't the only one and DeMarco blew up all over the world. It must have been rather difficult for Mac, who seemed to appreciate having his own thing so much, to be seen and followed by so many others (including me). I don't want to dive deep in to his personal life as I know nothing about him but DeMarco always seemed to remain humble and grateful for his fans and his recognition. I liked that about him.

Yet after _This Old Dog_ his fame grew ever so big that it felt like Mac did not know how to handle it. I always appreciated Mac DeMarco for doing what he did but on _Here Comes The Cowboy_, it felt like DeMarco struggled with balancing making music other people liked and making music he enjoyed making. I ended up really liking his _Other Here Comes The Cowboy Demos_ with all the finnicky demos that didn't make the actual album. On _The Other Demos_ I got to see the Mac I knew from my youth. His demos sound like a track you would get from your childhood friend. Mac seemed to be himself, and he is fucking amazing when he gets to be himself. 

Though most known for his shoegaze, with albums like _2_, _Salad Days_ and _Another One_, I believe DeMarco thrives on non-perfectionism. The looser he gets to be, the more soulful his songs become. On _Guitar_ Mac has grown and realised this. I don't think Mac will ever be completely serious, but he is at its most vulnerable here. He talks about cheating, dying, regrets, isolation, break ups... but without any kind of drama. The songs are well recorded and definitely demo-like but they aren't over processed or anything. They seem to resonate what Mac DeMarco is all about, simple, humble, genuine.

_Guitar_ has more than just a guitar but it's not much more than that. His classic soft drums and a simple punchy bass, at times maybe a back up in the vocals. Other than that it is the same old Mac DeMarco. Only this time one who seems to have found some peace with being world famous and finally gets to do his own thing again. I'm happy for him and grateful for his music. 

Thank you for being who you are Maccie.
