## I love my Computer (2025)
_by Ninajirachi_

_If EDM is not your thing I doubt you'll have the capacity to enjoy this._

Right in your face and subtle at the same time. The first three songs fit into each other like puzzle pieces. For the first ten to fifteen minutes you get blasted with silly lyrics and noises that feel funny down under and you most likely want to get drowned in the noise even more. With the fourth song Nina mixes it up a little. The introduction of techno elements allows for the transition to "_Delete_" where her lyrics become more introspective and vulnerable. All the while Nina doesn't miss a single opportunity to make your head jerk of your neck completely or for you to realise you're already on the next song.

At this point I want you to (re)discover the journey Ninajirachi sets you on in "_I love my computer_" by yourself. However I will add this; Ninajirachi caught me by surprise when I first heard it and somehow also gets better the more I listen to it. The album seems to center around themes of melancholy and nostalgia giving a lot of 2000 vibes but I honestly hope she will set a tone for me to be nostalgic for in twenty years.

(also she is my age which I find both difficult and awesome)

9/10
