## I WANT TO SEE THE LIGHT
_by toe_

I really want to like this album. "_the book about my idle plot on a vague anxiety_" might be my all time favorite album in the math rock genre. When reading reviews on Bandcamp, I thought this new album would be in the same calliber if not higher. However I must admit I somewhat regret having bought this album. There are some good songs on here and I admire the changes _toe_ deliberately make to endeavour on their own musical sound. But they lost me with most of the decisions made. 

What I liked so much in "_the book about my idle plot on a vague anxiety_" was the raw fire it carried. Simple melodic hypnotizing guitar melodies that change more often than not to tell a whole story, the most complex and perfect accompanying drums and a (relative) simple bass to glue the two together. It is an unpolished, yet intrinsically well woven album that has talent and craftmanship written all over it.

"_I WANT TO SEE THE LIGHT_" still carries their craftmanship and in no way do I want to say _toe_ are a one-trick-pony. But the rawness is gone. _toe_ has gone for a clean and polished sound. The over-the-topped bussed drums have been switched for tranquil and simpler drums that are much more monotone to allow other elements to come to the forefront. The guitar is still there but more to accompany vocal chops or to emphasize the chords - they don't tell the story anymore.

Maybe I have not given this album proper time or attention and I'm unsure as to whether I will soon, but from the two/three times I gave it a spin nothing really struck out that made me want to give it a second chance.
