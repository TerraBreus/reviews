## Champion 
_by Pom Poko_

Their previous album "_Cheater_" was on repeat for a long time back in 2021. With this in mind their new album did not stick in the same way. I believe this was due to their change in sound. 

In "_Cheater_" the songs were messy, rough and gritty but so damn catchy. It was a mix of punk and free jazz accessible for a pop audience (which is a f*cking awesome combination btw). Some of these elements can be found in songs like _My Family_ but they are much rarer and feel more like a reference than the core of this album.
Unfortunately at a loss of catchiness in my eyes, their latest album seems to be more quiet and less well defined. 

There is still potential with song like _Champion_ and _Bell_ where I found myself adhering to the new sweet & tender vibe.
However songs like _You're not Helping_ and _Go_ made me want to stop listening completely.

Overall there are some good songs on this record, but the album lacks the backbone that makes it a comfortable listening experience. I'm afraid it felt more like a collection of songs rather than an actual album.

4/10
