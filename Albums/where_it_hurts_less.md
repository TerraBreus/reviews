## Where It Hurts Less (2025)
_by GENDEMA_

A very different style from my very beloved _Sassy Things_. The very first song is an absolute masterpiece which led me to believe this album was worth a shot. However unfortunately afterwards the album takes a spiral. It's consistency feels flawed and the songs losely tied together. I cannot tell exactly what emotion I am supposed to have when listening to this album which brings me to feel very little if nothing at all. 

I would take the first and fifth song and leave out all the rest. The rest of the album may have some interesting ideas here and there but does not seem to be able to fit itself into the picture.

3/10?
