## Choke Enough
_by Oklou (2025)_

Took a long time to get in to and still it does not always hit the way I intend. However there have been times where I really enjoyed the (sometimes even somewhat comical) use of heavy electronics and autotune. The first time I listened to the entire album (which took a couple of attempts) I was rewarded by the banger _blade bird_ and it was due to this song that I came back to the album more. _Take my the hand_ then started playing in my head too after a couple of spins. Yet some songs simply sound a little too overdone to be taken serious (_thank you for recording_).

6/10
