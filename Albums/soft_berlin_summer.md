_By Loutouse_

From what I can gather this is more a collection of singles than an actual album. The album doesn't seem to take you anywhere nor does the order of songs have any importance. You might as well play this in shuffle to spicen things up a little.  

With that in mind I would take what you can get. Some songs hit a sweet spot of sounding nostalgic and hopeful with '_walk each other home_' as Loutouse's strongest tribute. The rest is kinda _meh_. There are some weird moments were it almost looks like Loutouse is trying to cover up impatience as an artistic choice. The songs with Jonaz straight up make me want to vomit with slimebal vocals that give the impression of a prepubescent boy talking about their first heartbreak. At most, I could say it is impressive how Loutouse is able to generate emotions (though they do feel somewhat superficial) with instruments alone. But he wouldn't be the first person to do that...

Not to sound like a basic bitch, but I much more prefer Fred Again.
