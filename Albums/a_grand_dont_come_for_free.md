## A Grand Don't Come for Free (DNF)
_By The Streets_

His debut album "_Original Pirate Material_" had a similar charming style of DIY-amateur-esque sprinkled with some bangers that will keep you coming back. "_A grand don't come for Free_" has many songs that at first sound straight up horrible (which on _Original Pirate Material_ made the album so incredibly charming and refreshing). Affter having the album on my iPod for a while now I still struggle to listen to the album as a whole. On his debut album, the amount of bangers made it possible for the listening experience to be enjoyable from the start and over time the "rubbish" songs started to appear creative and witty once I got used to the style and round to what he was saying. But this is not a praise for _Original Pirate Material_, this is a review of _A grand Don't Come FOr Free_.

Mike Skinners' second album seems to lack that same kind of _joy de vivre_ that makes a song stand out and stick. Maybe I haven't given it enough listens but the lack of bangers make the album difficult to come back to. I often found myself picking out the bits and pieces I liked instead of enjoying the album as a whole.
