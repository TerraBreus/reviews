**Chewy toffee that sticks**

Ah man, when I first heard this album I immediately fell in love with its charisma. Right from the start you get smacked in the face with heavy guitars and after that it's just banger after banger after banger. Catchy riffs that do not sound repetitive, groovy bass lines, groovy drums and funky synths. Top that with some lovely percussion, brass additions and a clean, warm mix and this album will take you on a journey of absolute ear candy.

This album was on repeat for weeks. I did not want to listen to anything else. And every time it would be the entire album I'd listen to, not just skip through the songs I didn't like - there weren't any.

If you're like me, you eat candy till you get sick of it. This album is like that exactly - chewy toffee that sticks to your teeth. A true gem that will dance in your head even when you're not listening, but if overplayed you will most likely get sick of it eventually.
