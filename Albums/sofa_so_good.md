## Sofa so good
_by Totorro_

Having seen some live performances from this band on the YouTubes, I was astounded by the copious amounts of talents these guys have. With only four bandmates, Totorro establishes a full and definitive sound that feels like a fine overdose of a double tripple espresso.

The album starts with an absolute blast. _Bang Bang_, _Matthews Bridge_ and _New Music_ are exactly what I wanted to hear from these guys. Two guitars applying the finest formula's math rock has to offer with drums that make you want to grab some chopsticks and join. 

After these songs though, the band comes to a halt. I'm not sure what they were thinking here. The heavy calculus is swapped for some simple primary school like adding and subtracting. The songs feel slow and the change is way too sudden after three head bangers to come to such a sudden stop. Especially the album title _Sofa So Good_ is simple, slow and shallow, which makes me think I missed something here. Why did they think this song was so good to give it the credit of the album? I mean, they did not release music for nine years and created a song called _New Music_ that slaps your fucking wrists of your arms. Why not name the album to that?

The album tries to pick up the pace again after this stop but most if its momentum is already lost. This could have been on repeat for months. Instead I will most likely add one third of it to a math rock playlist.

4/10
