###### The idea behind this repository is inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4YjXJVzoZY).

## What is this repo?
_```In a world with infinite information available at your fingertips, it is easy to get lost in a world of consumption. This repository is an antidote to that. 
By writing (short) reviews on what I consume, I hope to restore balance between the subtle counterplay of creation and consumption.```_

#### Possible positive consequences
```
- Increased writing skills.
- Forming and understanding my own opinion.
- Clearer thinking.
- Mindful consumption.
- Better memory.
```
#### Rules I try to abide
```
- Don't wait too long with writing after you have consumed.
- NO AI! Beats the whole purpose of this repo...
- No additional sources to influence your opinion.
```
