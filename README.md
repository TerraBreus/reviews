## Update Feb 2026.
###### My life at the moment is overflooding with responsibilities I have put upon myself. As a result I have been rather overwhelmed and struggled to find the time or motivation to revise what I have consumed. Slowly but surely I am trying to go through the backlog of the last two months. Untill that time I try not to consume anything new (which is rather difficult). I have allowed myself to reread the Harry Potter franchise alongside with the movies as a way of winding down and, perhaps a single review about the entire franchise will be made. However currently I am mostly glad I am reading books as way of relaxing and do not wish to increase any thresholds.

###### The idea behind this repository is inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4YjXJVzoZY).

## What is this repo?
_```In a world with infinite information available at your fingertips, it is easy to get lost in consumption. This repository is an antidote to that. 
By writing (short) reviews on what I consume, I hope to restore balance between the subtle counterplay of creation and consumption.```_

#### Possible positive consequences
```
- Increased writing skills.
- Forming and understanding my own opinion.
- Clearer thinking.
- Mindful consumption.
- Better memory.
```
#### Rules I try to abide
```
- Don't wait too long with writing after you have consumed.
- NO AI! Beats the whole purpose of this repo...
- No additional sources to influence your opinion.
```
