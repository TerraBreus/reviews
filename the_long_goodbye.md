**The Long Goodbye (1973)** - directed by Robert Altman

One of those movies that just makes sense. You just have to sit there and let the movie do the talking. This movie feels like cocaine and cigarettes. Some weird fever dream where, even though there is so much to focus on, you know exactly what is important and what isn't. The dialogue really stood out with Phillip Marlow (Elliot Gould) talking like he acts - a lot of balls and crack yet somehow he bluffs his way through with elegance and a reassurance that is soothing to watch.

I don't know what to tell you. I found this movie refresing. Maybe I really needed to watch it. The movie sets the tone right from the start by addressing feeding his cat with the same tonality as murder. If you like the first 10 minutes of the movie, you'll like the rest of it too. 

Again, great acting, great dialogue and great storytelling.

7/10
