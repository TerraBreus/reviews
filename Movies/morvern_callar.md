## Morvern Callar (2002)
_Directed by Lynne Ramsay_

Everyone has their own critique for what makes a movie good and I'm sure my review won't reach a general consensus or be an objective measurement. This movie is full of metaphors and symbolism. However for the average viewer these are difficult to pick up on. 

What is left then is a somewhat-of-a-fever-dream-like movie about coping and self-transformation. With the beauty of Schotland and Spain on the background, the shots are well made but don't flow as fluently like you see with movies such as "_Perfect Days_" (Wim Wenders) or "_Paterson_" (Jim Jarmusch). For the storyline, interesting takes on a plot and peculiar scenarios allow Samantha Mortor to create depth for her character Morvern Callar. However I presume this might be more credited toward the book (Morvern Callar by Alan Warner).

For me, a good movie leaves _some_ intellectual substance for you to chew on. This movie however stuffs your mouth so you can barely close it. If that is your jam, it is a pretty good movie. If not, this movie does not have as much to offer you.

5/10
