## Köln 75 (2025)
_Directed by Ido Fluk_

Coming out of the cinema I felt rather satisfied with _Köln '75_. Now, a week later, I can't remember exactly why - making this a rather difficult review to make. It is interesting to me that, though Keith Jarret is apparently very well known in the jazz-world, I have never heard his name. To think then, that "his" movie is really about the girl who organized it, I find rather funny.

Mick (buddy who joined me for the movie) thought there was too much positivity. There wasn't anything edgy or harsh. I disagreed, stating how much the young Vera Brandes (Mala Emde) had to fight with the arrogancy of man in order to make herself be heard and get her way. At the end though, I will say this looked like a feel good movie, so of course everything goes right in the end. If you know Keith Jarret's album "_The Köln Concert_", this wouldn't really be a surprise.

Ah, some of it is coming back now. Yes. At times, _Köln 75_ very deliberately breaks the fourth wall. The primary use seemed to inform the audience what made this performance (and Keith Jarret in general) so special and most times they were able to get a joke out of it too. This gave the entire movie a bit of a lighthearted touch which was rather enjoyable.

Overall, an informative feel good movie without too much cheese that tries to keep things somewhat light.

6/10
