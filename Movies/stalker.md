## Stalker (1979) [DNF]
_directed by Andrey Tarkovsky_

Fell asleep during the movie so did not watch it in its entirity. The movie is very slow and can be interpreted in many many ways. I particularly enjoyed the hypnotic "_thadum thadum_" when on the railway towards the zone. This very slow and long scene has you falling asleep in to the sounds of the railway untill suddenly color appears and they have reached the zone. Because I was so hypnotized by the scene before it took me a good ten seconds or so to realize color had appeared. That was some good use of cinematogrophy!

A lot can be said about _Stalker_ and considering how I have three minutes to finish this review I will not do it justice. However in short, what I got from it. _Stalker_ seems to be a movie about religion, where the protagonist is one of the few who still claims to have access to it and allows passage for others to get in touch with God. The other two characters seem to take a different perspective towards religion where one is a scientist who wants to blow this "heaven" up and the other a psychologist who is convinced religion is a mere figment of the mind. Tarkovsky critiques this ever so slightly by adding unrealistic scenes at the end of the movie. Yet, at the same time _Stalker_ can be seen as a critique for and against religion/belief/faith. 

Deserves to be seen at a later stage of life when my attention span is much, much stronger! (and when I haven't drunk two beers to make me eepy)
