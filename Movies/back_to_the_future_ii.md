## Back to the future (part II) (1989)
_Directed by Robert Zemeckis_

Surprisingly not much has changed in the staff. The same cast and the same director but a very different movie. I found myself cringing through the poorly written, cheesy slapstick parts of the movie which unfortunately was more than fourty percent of the movie. All of the elements that made the first part so unique were disregarded. The first movie was a silly fairytale where, even though you could guess the plot ten minutes through the movie, you could still enjoy the way the story was told. Its sequel feels more like an obnoxious plastic knock-off that tries to surf along on the wave of its predecessor. Most of the enjoyable scenes really were just reenactments of the first movie.

Now I know I just said the plot wasn't the selling factor of either movies but I reckon putting them side to side will show how one has more potential to shine through in other ways.
- Marty must make his mother, who accidentally fell in love with Marty cause he saved his (younger) father, fall in love again with his father by having them go to the ball together. All the while he must also find a way with the younger Doc to gather enough electrical energy so Marty can go back to the future.
- When Marty and Doc go to the year 2015 to prevent Marty's son from going to jail, a senile Bill (McFly's arch nemesis) sends his twenty-year old self a sports magazine so he can get rich. Thus Marty and Doc must go back to 1955 (the same year where the first movie takes place) to steal the magazine back from him.

Just like the first movie, the second one ends with an opening for a follow-up. However they lost me with this one.
