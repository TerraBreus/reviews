## Habfürdő (1979)
_(bubble bath) directed by György Kovásznai_

Probably a hit or miss for many.

The very fabric of this whimsical musical is creativity itself with ideas woven not only through the story but through the media itself. For some, this may be overwhelming and for other this may be a never ending well of inspiration. As an average movie-enjoyer, I found it hard to enjoy the visuals while reading the subtitles at the same time so I tend to lean more towards the overwhelming side. It also took me a good half of an hour to get used to the dramatic creativity used.

However I will say this, the animation visually is absolutely striking, the music is awesome and funky, the story line is chewy yet easily digestible and the characters are... well quite the characters. As an artist Kovásznai is clearly one of a kind and an inspiration to many. But for your average Sunday movie night? ...I wouldn't be too sure.
