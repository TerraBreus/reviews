## It's Winter
_directed by Rafi Pitts (2006)_

A movie for and by the middle class in Iran. Though less than ninety minutes, the movie feels incredibly slow, which is part of the magic and in some way even symbolizes winter itself. Pitts seems to be incredibly aware of what the viewer seems to expect in the end, which I very much enjoyed. After a whole eighty minutes of learning the characters, you start to predict how they behave and Pitts makes use of that. The last ten minutes are a wonderful example of _"show don't tell"_. Without the ending the movie is _so so_. Slow but realistic. There was one particular moment where I felt the warmth of human connection that drives the middle class and felt very touched (when the two friends went out). The movie is brilliant in dialogue. Friends are rough to each other, yet there remains a mutual understanding that connects people in their world.  

7/10
