## Little Children
_Directed by Todd Field_

###### _At the time of writing more than a month has passed, making this review quite difficult to write in detail. I completely agree that a more detailed review would be better and this movie surely is worthy of a more refined review. But any review is still better than no review at all. And remember the point is not to write good reviews, but to write. Don't let your perfectionism control you to the point where pressure to perform outweighs the momentum needed to begin._

Ugh... It is such a strange feeling to love a movie that makes you feel all rotten, twisted, scared and upset inside. 

But this movie is without a doubt a masterpiece. I got completely caught off guard by the story line, which reflected the absurdity of humans in their darkest and most mundane moments of our lives. There is so much more to say for this movie and if I ever find the courage to watch this movie again, I hope I will. 

For now I will leave you with the ending words that this is not a feel-good love story. This is love story about adults metaphorically acting like little children and gets very very dark...

8/10
