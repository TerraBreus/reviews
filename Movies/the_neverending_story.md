## The NeverEnding Story
_directed by Wolfgang Petersen (1984)_

As an adult seeing this movie for the first time fourty years after it has been released little of its magic found itself to me. The script is made very much for children and the acting feels childish, which makes sense considering the protagonist is a child. I will not attack this movie as a friend of mine holds this movie close to her heart and I'm sure many others have fond childhood memories here. However, it is not for me. What I liked most were the costumes of all the mythical creatures in this movie but for the directing, acting or story little can be said. The movie asks me to behave and have the imagination and emotion of a child which I (both fortunately as unfortunately) do not have. 

Most of the time I was laughing due to its absurdly ridiculous and dramatic scenes which, again, **as an adult** simply do not trigger what the movie asks for.

2/10
