## A bout de souffle

_Directed by Jean Luc Goddard_

good plot/story and acting. A movie about freedom. 
Ironic title in both ways, guy smokes all the time and is always on the run.
Does not feel very human for me. People are selfish and confidently ego centric, the movie and characters are aware of this 
yet their acknowledgement of selfawarement does not seem to give any depth to it.

We learn very little on what drives people to be who they want to be. Perhaps this can be found in between the lines but I was unable to find any.
I found the cinematogrohy woodenly rigid. Rough, long and tedious. Jean Luc Goddard is not everyone's cup of tea. 
I can see why people think this is a good movie and it feels unique.
Unique but not refreshing or satisfying to me due to its janky use of camera and a certain American-French arrogancy I simply could not emphasize with. 

However this might be a movie I could emphasize with at an older stage of life.

5/10
