## A bout de souffle 1960

_Directed by Jean Luc Goddard_

"_Après tout, je suis con_" Poiccard opens the movie with as he reads the newspaper: _After all I am an idiot_. Poiccard does what he wants when he wants to and not in the self-assured quiet way. Poiccard is noisy, loud, selfish and indeed (in my opinion) quite the idiot. Somewhere I believe this is what Goddard also wanted you to believe. To show your own internalized believes we hide under the name of common sense. 

_A bout de souffle_ is well recognized. You either hit or miss when it comes to Goddard. Some filmfanatics love him and some despise him. Personally I wouldn't call myself a huge fan. It took me a lot of effort to keep my attention partially due to the janky editing. I can't put my finger on it precisely (as I am stupidly writing this review almost two months later) but the cinematography feels very stiff. From what I know Goddard would create the scene on the spot and perhaps it is this that gives the movie its "New Wave" title. For me that just meant stiff editing and unnatural cuts.

Or perhaps it is the lack of depth we get from the characters. We get to see their behaviours and reactions to their surroundings but are left in the dark as to why. Goddard refuses to, what I find so stereotypically _Parisian_, humanize the characters. Only a little is given on the American Patriccia Franchini as to why she is the way she is.

Nevertheless there are a lot of good things to be said about this movie. Politically, it is incredibly literate but I am not the person to talk to for that. I like movies for empathetic element; to dive into someone's life and experience the world through another lens. Not to reflect on society or critique movements.

Unique but neither refreshing nor satisfying to me due to its janky use of camera and editing. And the certain American-French arrogancy I simply could not emphasize with. 

However this might be a movie I could emphasize with at an older stage of life.

5/10
