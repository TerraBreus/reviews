## Bariera (1966)
_directed by Jerzy Skolimowski_

_```"Oh geese who lost a bird's ambition to fly, because you got too fat. Geese! I understand you."```_

A lot went over my head and even though the movie is only 77 minutes, it is quite a difficult watch. Having said that, some moments struck out to me as a mildly amusing critique on modern day idealogy that is relevant sixty years later still. 

Halfway through, one of the protagonists looks almost directly to the viewers. '_One in six died in that war. I listen to their songs, I listen to the lyrics. What about our songs? "I can make it"_' she says. 

Now, I never payed enough attention in history class to understand what Poland was really like in the sixties, but translated to my own time this feels to adress the lack of purpose and meaning life now has. My view seemed to get set onto the idea that life in "modern" and "liberated" poland wasn't as grand as they wanted it to be. Life's purpose was filled by status, money, cars and girls and the two protagonist seem to somehow want to rebel against that by falling in love (?).

The two quotes in this review really struck out to me and made me think. There is plenty of symbolism and insight left to pluck out but my inner film student must have been busy elsewhere.
