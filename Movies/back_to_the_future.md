## Back to the future (1985)
_Directed by Robert Zemeckis_

### A mix of milk and wine.
The women are completely powerless and a mere attribute of a men's status which perhaps made sense at the time but now feels wrong and shallow. The target audience was clearly focused on young men in the eighties and if you're not one of them you'll likely have some problems with it. However just like with old Disney stories, if you are able to look through the conformity they wanted you to believe in, you are left with a timeless piece of work. 

"Back to the future" is made from the stuff fairytales are made of. You know exactly what is going to happen and the story leaves little surprises (though still some!). What gets you hooked though is the charisma this movie sparks with, the attention to detail they have given the sets, the quirky characters you can't help but feel for - everyone in this movie just feels so damn authentic!

I immediately wanted to watch the sequel after!

7/10
