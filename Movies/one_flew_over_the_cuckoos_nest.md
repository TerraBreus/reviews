## One flew over the cuckoo's nest (1975)

_Directed by Milos Forman_

As good as movies can get. Mat McMurphy (_Jack Nicholson_) _"fights and fucks too much"_. He is as tall as a mountain and not everyone likes that. After prison and community service, Mat hasn't shrunk a bit. In an attempt to understand his behavior, Mat gets sent(enced?) to a psychiatric hospital. From the moment you get introduced to this "outlaw" you can't help but like Mat. I wish I could pinpoint what makes Nicholson such a great actor but believe you me this movie radiates charisma.

With a young Danny deVito and many other great actors this movie has you laughing at the silly loveable characters. As the "mentally ill" flourish under the presence of McMurphy's rebellious nature, problems start to arise with maintaining peace and control. A critique not only on psychiatric institutions, but on "fitting in" in general. 

9/10
