## Splitsville (2025)
_Directed by Michael Angelo Covino_

### A decent movie about horrible people
A couple of days after having watched this movie not much seems to have stuck itself to my brain. I remember enjoying the movie, but it wasn't anything too special. If you put a lot of money into anything it's not that difficult to make anything worthwhile watching. 

The characters are extremely self centered and Julie (Dakota Johnson) seems to be the only one who has some common sense. Though even that is questionable at times. 
The name of the movie isn't that difficult to figure out. What if you have all the people you split up with live with you? Well that's pretty much what happens in this movie. It's like one of those _love island_ shows. Only this time it is a movie and the people are succesful and wealthy. 

When looking up the director of the movie (who is also the writer and one of the protagonists) I happened to find a [general consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitsville_(film)#cite_note-Rotten_Tomatoes-13) on the movie:

`A classic farce with very modern relationship dynamics`

It is supossed to be a comedy at the end of the day, so I can't judge this too harshly but if this is what they think a modern relationship looks like I would recommend couple therapy.

I also get the feeling this movie widely appreciated because it has Dakota Johnson playing in it, but if that is what makes the movie good I think you know what kind of a movie it is.

6/10
