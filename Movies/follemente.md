## Follemente (2025)
_directed by Paolo Genovese_

If I had known beforehand "Follemente" was made for Disney+ I wouldn't have bothered, but since I was already at the cinema's I figured '_eh why not?_'. That clearly was a mistake. After two minutes of confusion you understand the writers made a clear spin off from "Inside Out". Only this time it is about a man and a woman both on a first date wanting to get laid (_surprise surprise, they end up having sex_).

What to expect from Disney+? All of the checkboxes were ticked to avoid offending anybody. A young (stereotypically attractive) feminist who hates men yet can't help but be attracted to them? Check. A sexy middle-aged divorced dad who desperately wants to have sex but also deep inside has a soft spot? Check. Corny jokes about the differences between men and women? Check. 

I would even go as far as to say this movie is somewhat sexist, only they translated it to the standards of today as not to seem too obnoxious. All of the thinking is already done for you, you just have to sit there and conform to the stereotypes of modern life.

The most I can say is this; it hits the bare **bare** minimum of being an enjoyable movie. This is the kind of movie you watch at 2 AM when you're baked as fuck and can barely keep your eyes open, or when you're really, really hungover.

2/10
