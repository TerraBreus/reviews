## Foxy Brown (1974)
_Written and directed by Jack Hill_

#### "_Cultclassic not bestsellah_" - Mike Skinner  (_Original Pirate Material_). 

Well... Jack Hill seemes to have taken a similar standpoint. _Foxy Brown_ does not try to appeal to all. But for some, this might very well be their all time favorite.

This movie was selected by my go-to cinema in celebration of the seventies "amateur films". In that regard it fits right in. This is no hollywood movie and some parts feel quick and odd which also gives it a unique and warm authenticity you don't see often. Characters are flawed and annoying. Dialogue and acting sometimes feels very amateur. And the story isn't particularly outstanding either. But where it lacks in some parts, it makes up in others. Visually, _Foxy Brown_ is outstanding. The title screen starts with a neon green background and woman dancing in masked red which immediately draws you to the color pallet and idealogy of the movie; **right in your face**. Then the costumes... oh my god the costumes. The protagonist must've changed outfits a hundred times throughout the movie and all of them look fucking fantastic. This might be credited more to the seventies, but as someone too young to have lived them, I couldn't care less. 

Most of my critique on movies is from a rather feministic perspective and once again here it raises objections (what a surprise from a movie from the seventies). Though the protagonist is female, which I was hoping to be somewhat of a statement, she does not get portrayed in a way that invokes different views on gender equalities or beauty standards. To me it seemed rather more like Jack Hill chose a woman, not to make her feel powerful, but to make use of her aesthetic and huge watermelons. In that regard, _Foxy Brown_ is in the same ballpark as _SuperWoman_ or _Lara Croft's Tombraider_.

But apart from that I found little to complain. Jack Hill had a vision and focused on that vision alone. He wanted to make what he saw in his minds eye and couldn't really be bothered with what would make a movie generally succesful. Just for this authenticity I would say _Foxy Brown_ is worth watching at least once in your life.

7/10
