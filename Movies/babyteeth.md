## Babyteeth
_Directed by Shanon Murphy_

Painfully beautiful. The writers of the script must really understand human psychology. The characters are humanly flawed and vulnerably stupid making for poor life decisions in a way that only humans do. Not sure if I want to ever watch this movie again cause of the pain it shines on human life, but I am very glad to have seen it.

8/10
