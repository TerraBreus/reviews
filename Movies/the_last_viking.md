## The Last Viking
_Directed by Anders Thomas Jensen_

_The Last Viking_ is a mix of juxtapositions. While mainly centred around an absurd play of gruesomely dark humor, there are moments where I was genuinly scared or when I was so touched I started crying. 

The characters, as annoying as they sometimes can be grow on you as the plot thickens (and trust me, it thickens quite a lot). At the end I was happy it was over and sad it had ended. The movie comes full circle in a wonderful way with a beautifully sad and funny statement to end it on: _only in death are we equal_. (credit to Mick who once again joined me on this movie and shared me his thoughts)

If you like dark humor and are not afraid of blood this is a unique and outstanding classic.

7.5/10
