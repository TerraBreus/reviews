**They Live** - A Movie by John Carpenter. Released in 1988.

The idea is awesome. Socially conditioned to pursue goals that really have a completely different and secret message. A billboard of an attractive lady in the carribean subconsciously states "Marry and Reproduce". 

Of course this is a sci-fi movie, so the evil bastards are aliens. Yet there is still this message: "Hey, advertisements and product placements are trying to strike your subconsciousness so you'll buy their product". I'm not giving this thought-experiment enough justice but just for this alone, I would say it's worth watching.

Unfortunately, I would say that is about the only thing I found interesting. The rest of this movie is filled with bad dialogue, stiff acting, a poor storyline, unnecessarily long fighting scenes and an american-esque obsession with guns.

4/10
